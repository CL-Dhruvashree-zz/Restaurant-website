From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasred, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out , producing a cuo of coffee. </h1>
