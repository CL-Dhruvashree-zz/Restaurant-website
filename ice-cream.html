    text-align:center;"> Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative , and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruits such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizer. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures. It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases. </h1>
